// Module Rules
//
// As briefly mentioned in the previous section, a Module is a more discrete
// component of the page. It is your navigation bars and your carousels and
// your dialogs and your widgets and so on. This is the meat of the page.
// Modules sit inside Layout components. Modules can sometimes sit within
// other Modules, too. Each Module should be designed to exist as a standalone
// component. In doing so, the page will be more flexible. If done right,
// Modules can easily be moved to different parts of the layout without
// breaking.
//
// When defining the rule set for a module, avoid using IDs and element
// selectors, sticking only to class names. A module will likely contain a
// number of elements and there is likely to be a desire to use descendent
// or child selectors to target those elements.
