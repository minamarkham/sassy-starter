// Layout Rules
//
// Layout styles can also be divided into major and minor styles based on
// reuse. Major layout styles such as header and footer are traditionally
// styled using ID selectors but take the time to think about the elements
// that are common across all components of the page and use class selectors
// where appropriate.
