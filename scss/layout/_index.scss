// Layout Rules
//
// Layout styles can also be divided into major and minor styles based on
// reuse. Major layout styles such as header and footer are traditionally
// styled using ID selectors but take the time to think about the elements
// that are common across all components of the page and use class selectors
// where appropriate.



.container {
  // background-color: lighten(orange, 30%);

.box {
  @include span(1);
  height: 200px;
  background-color: red;
  &:last-child {
    margin: 0;
